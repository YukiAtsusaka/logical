This R package computes and visualizes the quantitative predictions of the logical model of minority candidate emergence introduced by Atsusaka (2020) ["A Logical Model for Predicting Minority Representation: Application to Redistricting and Voting Rights Studies"](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3637699).

## `minorep`: Predict the Probability of Minority Candidate Emergence and Electoral Success
Predict a probability at which minority candidates run for office and win races in districts with specified values of *M* and *C* as follows:

```r
rmargin <- c(20, 50, 30)   # Half the Difference between the Top Minority and Top White Vote Shares
VAP <- c(40, 70, 85)       # Minority Voting-Age Population
rep.prob <- minorep(M=rmargin, C=VAP)
rep.prob
# [1] 0.9982217 1.0000000 1.0000000
```
<br/>

### Motivating Examples (1): Influence Districts in *Hayes v. Louisiana* (1992)
In *Heyes v. Louisiana* (1992), one of the main controversies was about the empirical validity of the claim that minority voters can influence electoral results (to elect minority candidates) in districts with about 20% minority voters. While the plaintiffs maintained that such districts can be minority *influence* districts, the state contended that "there was no evidence" to support such a theory given a strong racially polarized voting pattern (Enstrgom and Kirksey 1998, 250). The logical model offers one answer to this debate: the probability of minority candidate emergence in districts with 20% minority voters with a strong racially polarized voting pattern is almost 0. Other claims have been that 35% to 45% (*Heyes v. Louisiana* (1994))(Enstrgom and Kirksey 1998, 258) minority voters are sufficient to provide minority voters with a realistic chance to elect a candidate of their choice.

## `redistrict`: Simulated the Probability of Minority Representation in Varying District Racial Compositions
Generate a probability of minority candidate emergence with specified levels of minority co-ethnic voting and White crossover voting as follows:

```r
# Suppose we have two district plans for which we know the expected behaviors of minority and white voters 
# (from surveys, exit polls, ecological inference, historical analyses, etc)

# Plan1 
# 90% of minority voters are expected to vote for the minority candidate (Strong Minority Bloc Voting)
# 0% of white voters are expected to vote for the minority candidate (No White Crossover)

# Plan2
# 90% of minority voters are expected to vote for the minority candidate (Strong Minority Bloc Voting)
# 30% of white voters are expected to vote for the minority candidate (Moderate White Crossover)

plan1 <- redistrict(coethnic=0.9, crossover=0)  
plan2 <- redistrict(coethnic=0.9, crossover=0.3) 
```

<br/>

## `plot.redistrict`: (1) Visualize the Impact of Redistricting on the Probability of Minority Electoral Success


```r
myplans = cbind(plan1, plan2)
myrange = c(44,55) # From 44% to 55%
plot.redistrict(plans=myplans, range=myrange)

# To Add Title, etc.
text(x=start, y=1.1, labels="Moderate white crossover",
      cex=1, col="maroon", font=2)
text(x=start+10, y=-0.09, labels="No white crossover",
     cex=1, col="seagreen", font=2)
 title("With Strong Minority Bloc Voting")
```

## `plot.redistrict`: (2) Visualize the Percentage of Minority Voters Sufficient to Elect Minority Candidates with A Pre-Specified Probability

Users can pre-specified a threshold as a probability of minority electoal success under given district plans. For example, one may be interested what percentage of minority voters is sufficient to yield 80% or higher chance of having a minority officeholder under two different plans (from the above examples). Under this option, a probability (from 0 to 1) must be input for the optional argument "threshold" as follows:

```r
myplans = cbind(plan1, plan2)                  # Same Plans from Above
plot.redistrict(plans=myplans, threshold=0.8)  # Setting 0.8 as a threshold value

# To Add Title, etc.
text(x=start, y=1.1, labels="Moderate white crossover",
      cex=1, col="maroon", font=2)
text(x=start+10, y=-0.09, labels="No white crossover",
     cex=1, col="seagreen", font=2)
title("With Strong Minority Bloc Voting")
```



## `plot.redistrict`: (3) Visualize the Degree of Potential Vote Dilution

Building upon (2), one can also visualize the degree of potential vote dilution via "packing" of minority voters. For this option, one only needs to input a percentage point as an additional argument 

```r

myplans = cbind(plan1, plan2)                  # Same Plans from Above
plot.redistrict(plans=myplans, 
                threshold=0.8,                 # Setting 0.8 as a threshold value
                C=75)                          # A plan has 75% minority voters

# To Add Title, etc.
text(x=start, y=1.1, labels="Moderate white crossover",
      cex=1, col="maroon", font=2)
text(x=start+10, y=-0.09, labels="No white crossover",
     cex=1, col="seagreen", font=2)
title("With Strong Minority Bloc Voting")


```

### Extention I (Accounting for the Turnout Gap)
To account for the turnout gap in simulating *M*, one can simply include a vector of proportions of minority and white voters who turn out as an additional argument. Suppose that one knows that, from exit polls, surveys, ecological inference, and/or historical studies, turnout rates are usually 0.5 for minority voters and 0.6 for white voters.

```r
# Suppose we know/estimate that:
# 90% of minority voters are expected to vote for the minority candidate
# 30% of white voters are expected to vote for the minority candidate
# Turnout Rates are 50% (minority voters) and 60% (white voters)

plan3 <- redistrict(coethnic=0.9, crossover=0.3, gap=c(0.5, 0.6))
```

### Motivating Example (3): Louisiana Congressional District 4 Plan in 1992

Concerning the effectiveness of the plan for a new majority-minority District 4 supported by the Senate in the 1990 round of redistricting, "Sherman Copelin, the African-American representative who sponsored the [alternative] plan, complained that the new minority district in the plan passed by the Senate did not contain enough African-American voters to ensure that African-Americans would elect a candidate of their choice....The percentage of African-Americans among the registered voters in this district was 63.2, almost 4 percentage points higher than the second minority district in the other version" (Engstrom and Kirksey 1998, 245)
